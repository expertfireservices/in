                <h3>Steps for EPR Registration</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Identify the Relevant Authorities:</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Businesses must register with the local or national authority responsible for EPR compliance, such as an environmental ministry or waste management organization.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Determine the Scope of Responsibility:</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Identify which products fall under EPR schemes, such as:</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Packaging (plastic, paper, glass)</li>
                        <li>Electronics and electrical equipment (e-waste)</li>

                        <li>Household appliances</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>Not all products are subject to EPR rules, so accurate identification is crucial.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>

                      <li>Submit periodic reports on waste generation, recycling rates, and fees paid to authorities.</li>
                      <li>Adhere to recycling targets or waste reduction goals set by EPR regulations.</li>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Monitoring and Audits:</strong>
                    <ul>
